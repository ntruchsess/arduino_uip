This is UIPEthernet version 1.09

An plugin-replacement of the stock Arduino Ethernet library for ENC28J60 shields and breakout boards. Full support for persistent (streaming) TCP-connections and UDP (Client and Server each), ARP, ICMP, DHCP and DNS. 
Just include 'UIPEthernet.h' instead of 'Ethernet.h' and use all your code written for the stock Arduino Ethernet lib!

UIPEthernet is written as a wrapper around the mature uIP Stack by Adam Dunkels, which provides the low-level implementation for all supported protocols. To overcome the memory-constrains (a 'regular' uIP-application does all processing in RAM) the ENC28J60 internal memory is used for all stream buffers (in and out). Only 400-600 Bytes of Arduinos RAM are used (depending on the number of concurrently open connections). As of Flash-memory a ATmega368-based Arduino is the minimum requirenment.

This library is written by Norbert Truchsess <norbert.truchsess@t-online.de>

uIP was written by Adam Dunkels of the Networked Embedded Systems group at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science.

This library was inspired by the SerialIP implementation by Adam Nielsen <malvineous@shikadi.net>, actually I took this code as a starting point, but in the latest versions there are very few lines left.

Installation
------------

To install the libraries, you need to place them into your "libraries" folder. You can find it within your Arduino IDE distribution within the "hardware" folder.

    C:\> cd [path to Arduino distribution]\libraries
    C:\> git clone https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip UIPEthernet

Be sure to restart the IDE if it was running.

On a Mac, you will want to create a folder named "libraries" in in the "Documents" -> "Arduino" folder within your home directory. Clone the project there (and restart the IDE, if it was running during this process).

    $ cd ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries
    $ git clone https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip UIPEthernet
    
Or you download the zipped version of the library from https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip/releases, and copy the contained directory UIPEthernet to [path to Arduino distribution]\libraries\UIPEthernet.

If you are running Arduino-IDE 1.5.x use release-version 1.59 or checkout branch 'Arduino_1.5.x'
